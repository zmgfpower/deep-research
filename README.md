- [ ] Support for other LLM models

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Get [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. One-click deployment of the project, you can choose to deploy to Vercel or Cloudflare

   [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fu14app%2Fdeep-research&project-name=deep-research&repository-name=deep-research)

   Currently the project supports deployment to Cloudflare, but you need to follow [How to deploy to Cloudflare Pages](./docs/How-to-deploy-to-Cloudflare-Pages.md) to do it.

3. Start using

## ⌨️ Development

Follow these steps to get Deep Research up and running on your local browser.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.18.0 or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/u14app/deep-research.git
   cd deep-research
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install  # or npm install or yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and configure the following environment variables:

   ```env
   # (Optional) Server-side Gemini API Key (Required for server API calls)
   GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=

   # (Optional) Server API Proxy URL. Default, `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
   API_PROXY_BASE_URL=

   # (Optional) Server API Access Password for enhanced security
   ACCESS_PASSWORD=

   # (Optional) Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.
   HEAD_SCRIPTS=
   ```

   **Important Notes on Environment Variables:**

   - `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`: **Optional but required for using the server-side API.** You need to obtain a Google Generative AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). This key should be kept secret and **never committed to your public repository.**
   - `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`: **Optional.** If you need to use a proxy server for API requests, configure this variable with your proxy server's base URL. This is relevant for server-side API calls.
   - `ACCESS_PASSWORD`: **Optional but highly recommended for server-side deployments.** Set a strong password to protect your server-side API endpoints. This password will be required to access server-side API functionalities.
   - `HEAD_SCRIPTS`: **Optional** Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.

   **Privacy Reminder:** These environment variables are primarily used for **server-side API calls**. When using the **local API mode**, no API keys or server-side configurations are needed, further enhancing your privacy.
   **Multi-key Support:** Supports multiple keys, each key is separated by `,`, i.e. `key1,key2,key3`. **Cloudflare cannot use multi-key for the time being because the official build script does not support Next.js 15.**

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev  # or npm run dev or yarn dev
   ```

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access Deep Research.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fu14app%2Fdeep-research&project-name=deep-research&repository-name=deep-research)

### Cloudflare

Currently the project supports deployment to Cloudflare, but you need to follow [How to deploy to Cloudflare Pages](./docs/How-to-deploy-to-Cloudflare-Pages.md) to do it.

### Docker

> The Docker version needs to be 20 or above, otherwise it will prompt that the image cannot be found.

> ⚠️ Note: Most of the time, the docker version will lag behind the latest version by 1 to 2 days, so the "update exists" prompt will continue to appear after deployment, which is normal.

```bash
docker pull xiangfa/deep-research:latest
docker run -d --name deep-research -p 3333:3000 xiangfa/deep-research
```

You can also specify additional environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d --name deep-research \
   -p 3333:3000 \
   -e GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSy... \
   -e ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password \
   xiangfa/deep-research
```

or build your own docker image:

```bash
docker build -t deep-research .
docker run -d --name deep-research -p 3333:3000 deep-research
```

If you need to specify other environment variables, please add `-e key=value` to the above command to specify it.

Deploy using `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
version: '3.9'
services:
   deep-research:
      image: xiangfa/deep-research
      container_name: deep-research
      environment:
         - GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
         - ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password
      ports:
         - 3333:3000
```

or build your own docker compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

### Static Deployment

You can also build a static page version directly, and then upload all files in the `out` directory to any website service that supports static pages, such as Github Page, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc..

```bash
pnpm build:export
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

As mentioned in the "Getting Started" section, Deep Research utilizes the following environment variables for server-side API configurations:

- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
- `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`
- `ACCESS_PASSWORD`

These variables are **only required if you intend to use the server-side API calling functionality.** For local API calls, no configuration is necessary beyond setting up the project.

## 🛡️ Privacy

Deep Research is designed with your privacy in mind. **All research data and generated reports are stored locally on your machine.** We do not collect or transmit any of your research data to external servers (unless you are explicitly using server-side API calls, in which case data is sent to Google's Gemini API through your configured proxy if any). Your privacy is our priority.
